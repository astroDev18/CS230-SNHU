Final Submission

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a company that wanted to develop a mobile and PC game that was based around multiplayer quiz game. They wanted me to design software to handle the server side of the game and develop a front end client for each platform the game would run on. They wanted their game to be able to meet certain design requirements like being able to process high resolution images.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel like I addressed all of the design requirements of the documentation very thoroughly which can help the gaming room reach a solid conclusion and an informed basis to begin their development with. One area I feel I did particularly well with was the Recommendations section where I provided the gaming room with detailed information on the best path to choose when developing the app.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I believe the design document helped me by showing me a well researched opinion on all the options available to me in the document. It allowed me to compare and contrast different systems. I was able to develop by just referencing the document as a blueprint which saves me time and provides me with a plan to achieve. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I might revise my recommendations to include more emphasis on the client experience since that is what the user will be interacting with when they play the game. I would discuss more on the different languages they could use to create better UI's that provide a seamless experience accross different platforms. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
